# Hello World in Android

Hello Word project, used as introduction to Android apps development in the elective course "CPSC-4367 Mobile Apps Development" from UA Little Rock

## Description

Very basic Android app with just only one activity. The layout of the activity is simply composed by three of the most common Android GUI elements: a TextEdit, a TextView and a Button.
The user is supposed to input some text in the EditText element, so when he taps the button that text is shown from the TextView element.
